# 05 Lists

Making a list looks very like making a tuple:
```
y = ["Jim",25]
```
The statement above makes a list called y. Note the use of square brackets, which is different from how we make a tuple (which uses round brackets). Lists are a lot more flexible than tuples. For one thing we can change the content of their elements:
```
y[0]="James"
```
This statement changes the item at the start of y to “James”.
